# Folder "QuGCM" for Quantum Generator Coordinated Method (QuGCM)

Code and data for [QuGCM paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.023200)

It is better to directly go to the folder below, unless the interest is on the orginal data of the paper.

# Folder "ADAPT-CGM" for ADAPT-GCM

Code for reproducing experiments and data for the ADAPT-GCM part of the [ADAPT-GCM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07691). So it does not include ADAPT-VQE-GCM. It requires several python files (not need to install) to in the [ADAPT-VQE repo](https://github.com/mayhallgroup/adapt-vqe) and little modifications. An detailed instructions are included in the folder.
